Simple Web API to perform dynamic calculations.

To do list:
Unit Testing
Repository Interfaces for Data Persistence
Console application for long-running continuous calculations

For the Console application, the solution would be refactored. Services and their dependencies would be moved to a separate project so both the Web API and the Console Application would reference it.
